In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises from the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Specifically, memory leaks can occur when an object's retain count isn't properly managed, leading to objects not being deallocated when they're no longer needed.  This is especially problematic when dealing with complex object graphs or when using autorelease pools inappropriately. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... later in your code ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"]; //This creates another retain
[obj release]; //this will lead to a leak

```
In this code, `myString` is retained twice and the second retain is never released leading to a memory leak. Another common mistake is to forget to release objects within `dealloc` method or to release them multiple times.
